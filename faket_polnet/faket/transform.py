    Parameters
    ----------
    
    sinogram:  ndarray, shape (θ, Y, M)
        Three-dimensional array containing the projections.
        Axis 0 contains projections. Axis 1 is the tilt axis.
    theta: list or ndarray, shape (θ,)
        One-dimensional array of tilt angles in degrees. 
    downsample_angle: int, default=1 (no downsampling)
        Sinogram downsampling in theta dimension with int step.
        Always retains the angle in the center of theta.
    downsample_pre: int, default=1 (no downsampling)
        Sinogram downsampling in all space dimensions with int step.
    downsample_post: int, default=1 (no downsampling)
        Reconstruction downsampling in all space dimensions with int step.
    order: int, default=3
        Order (0 - 5) of the spline interpolation during downsampling.
    filtering: str or None, default=None
        Filter used during reconstruction with FBP algorithm.
        Accepts `approxShrec`, and in case `software='radontea'` accepts
        also filters from radontea {'ramp', 'shepp-logan', 'cosine', 
        'hamming', 'hann'}.
    filterkwargs: dict
        Additional kwargs for `approxShrec` filter.
    z_valid: 2-tuple, default=None (no slicing)
        Slices the reconstruction along the 0-axis (Z dimension)
        to a range of valid voxels given by a relative interval from 0 to 1. 
    output_mrc: str, default=None
        Path to the output mrc file. If None, no saving is done and
        reconstruction is just returned instead.
    ncpus: int, default=None
        If `software='radontea'` this is the number of CPUs used to do
        the reconstruction. If None, the number is set automatically 
        to all CPUs. Ignored if `software='imod'`. 
    fix_edges_proj: int, default=0
        Fixing artifacts as in SHREC baseline projections.
    fix_edges_rec: int, default=0
        Fixing artifacts as in SHREC baseline reconstructions.
    software: str, one of {'radontea', 'imod'}, default 'radontea'
        Specifies which software is used to do the reconstruction. 
        If 'imod', CLI program `tilt` from IMOD must be installed and
        available on PATH and executable.
