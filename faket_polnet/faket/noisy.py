def find_r_std(noisy, clean, start=0.0, stop=1.0, min_step=0.01, debug=False):
    """
    Find value of `r` that minimizes `f(r)` which is a function that subtracts 
    `clean` with μ=0 and σ=r from `noisy` with μ=0 and σ=1 and returns 
    the r and σ of the result.
    
    The idea is to scale `clean` using r such that it fits the signal in `noisy` as much
    as possible. If it would fit perfectly, `noisy - scaled_clean` has no signal
    at all and contians only noise. That does happen only approximately.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    noisy: 2D array containing one projection from TEM
    clean: 2D array containing simulated noiseless projection with content matching `noisy`
    start: float, left boundary of the interaval that is searched for plausible r
    stop: float, right boundary of the interval that is searched for plausible r
    min_step: float,  stop contidion for bisection
    debug: bool, if True does not bisect but plots results of r on a grid
    
    Notice
    ------
    Use this function on a 2D tilt data (not the whole 3D sinogram).
    
    Returns
    -------
    r: 
        the factor that scales standardized clean to fit standardized noisy
        I.e. it is the std of clean before the noise will be added
    subtracted.std(): the standard deviation of the estimated noise
    subtracted: the volume containing the estimated noise
